# [WIP] MapleStory 2 Discord News Bot
This Discord bot scrapes the MapleStory 2 news page and posts new entries to a channel.
It compares and writes to a local JSON file, which can easily be replaced with a database like mongodb.

### Requirements
```
nodejs
```

### Installation
This bot is written to run with node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
After it's installed, use `npm install` in the bot project to install all dependencies.

You have to add your own bot token to the `settings.json`, you can read more on how to generate a token [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
*Never share a token with other people*

### Running
You can start the bot with `node bot.js` or using the `start.sh` (linux) so your bot automatically reconnects if it loses the connection.

### Features
Coming soon

*Do not try to run this yet, it's not done!*
