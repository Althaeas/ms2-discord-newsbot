# [WIP] MapleStory 2 Discord News Bot
This Discord bot scrapes the MapleStory 2 news page and posts new entries to a channel.

### Installation
This bot is written to run with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After it's installed, use `npm install` in the bot project to install all dependencies.

You have to add your own discord user-id and a bot token to the `settings.json`, you can read more on how to generate a token [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

*Never share your token with other people*

### Run
You can start the bot with `node bot.js` command or using the `start.sh` (linux) so your bot automatically reconnects if it loses the connection.

### Features
Coming soon

*Do not try to run this yet, it's not done!*
