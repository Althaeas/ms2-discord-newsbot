# [WIP] MapleStory 2 Discord News Bot
This Discord bot scrapes the MapleStory 2 news page and posts new entries to a channel.

It compares and writes to a local JSON file, which can easily be replaced with a database like mongodb.

### Requirements
```
nodejs
```

### Installation
```
npm install
npm run start
```

### How to use
Coming soon

*Do not try to run this yet, it's not done!*
